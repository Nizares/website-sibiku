### Abstract
Deafness severely disrupts a person ability for communicate and can affect individual overall lifestyle and quality of life. Sign language is a language that uses communication other than sound in the form of hand movements, facial expressions, body movements, and so on. This research uses computer vision technology and deep learning with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the method to classify SIBI Latin alphabet. The method used for the research is CNN and Inceptionv3 architecture as a pre-training to build a model for classification. The data used in this study is SIBI alphabet data totaling 2600 image data and has 26 classes alphabet A to Z of each class has 100 image data. results of accuracy model training process been made with CNN architecture and Inceptionv3 get 98% accuracy, loss of 0.0811, accuracy validation of 97%, loss validation of 0.0803. Results for testing model using a multi-class confusion matrix get an average accuracy value of 99%, precision value 99%, recall value 99%, and f1-score value is 99%. It hoped this research can help users in learning the SIBI alphabet.
